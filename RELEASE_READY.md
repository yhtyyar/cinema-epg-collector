# Project Release Ready Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to prepare the Cinema EPG Collector project for release.

## Overview

The project has been thoroughly refactored and cleaned up to ensure it's ready for production deployment. All unnecessary files have been removed, documentation has been updated, and code quality has been significantly improved.

## Changes Made

### 1. Codebase Cleanup
- Removed `iptv_filter/` directory (unused code)
- Removed root `node_modules/` directory (frontend dependencies should be in `frontend/node_modules/`)
- Removed root `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (frontend dependencies are in the frontend directory)
- Removed temporary and unnecessary files

### 2. API Improvements
- Enhanced API startup configuration to allow running without data collection
- Added `POST /api/collect-data` endpoint for manual data collection
- Improved error handling and graceful degradation when data files are missing
- Updated default configuration to `AUTO_RUN_PIPELINE=false` for faster startup

### 3. Frontend Refactoring
- Enhanced type safety with comprehensive TypeScript types
- Improved component structure with proper memoization
- Added performance optimizations (debounce, memoization, etc.)
- Implemented better error handling with Error Boundary
- Added search functionality with debounce
- Created utility functions and constants for better code organization
- Updated component structure and naming conventions

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated main README with latest information
- Created comprehensive frontend documentation
- Added API startup documentation
- Documented refactoring changes

### 5. Testing and Quality Assurance
- Verified all changes work correctly
- Ensured proper error handling
- Tested API endpoints
- Verified frontend builds correctly

## Files Modified

- `node_modules/` - Root node_modules (frontend dependencies are in frontend directory)

## Testing

All changes have been tested to ensure:
- API starts correctly without data collection
- Manual data collection works via API endpoint
- Frontend builds correctly
- Error handling works properly
- Performance optimizations are effective
- All existing functionality is preserved

## Deployment

The project is now ready for production deployment. To deploy:

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the Python environment
3. Configure environment variables
4. Start the API server
5. Build and serve the frontend
