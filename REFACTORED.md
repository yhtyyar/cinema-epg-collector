# Project Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to refactor the IPTV EPG Collector project for simplified manual deployment on Ubuntu.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Simplification
- Removed complex deployment documentation files:
  - DEPLOYMENT.md
  - PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md
  - ZERO_TO_PRODUCTION.md
  - ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md
  - TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md
- Simplified README.md to focus on manual deployment
- Added UBUNTU_SETUP.md with detailed Ubuntu installation instructions
- Updated frontend README to be in English and focus on manual deployment

### 2. Script Cleanup
- Removed deployment scripts:
  - deploy.sh
  - deploy-production.sh
  - deploy-server.sh
  - bootstrap.sh
  - quick-start.sh
- Removed scripts directory and its contents

### 3. Configuration Updates
- Simplified docker-compose.yml with notes about manual deployment
- Updated Dockerfile with notes about manual deployment
- Updated docker-entrypoint.sh to be more focused
- Updated nginx configuration files with notes about manual deployment
- Updated frontend Dockerfile with notes about manual deployment

### 4. Files Kept for Reference
- .github/workflows/ci.yml (CI/CD workflow)
- All core application code in epg_collector/
- Frontend application code in frontend/
- Configuration files (.env.example, requirements.txt, etc.)

## Manual Deployment Instructions

For manual deployment on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

1. Review the simplified README.md
2. Follow the detailed instructions in UBUNTU_SETUP.md
3. Configure environment variables in .env
4. Run the data collection pipeline manually
5. Start the API server manually

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Simplified Documentation**: Removed complex deployment scenarios and focused on manual deployment
2. **Clearer Instructions**: Provided step-by-step Ubuntu setup guide
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Removed numerous deployment scripts that were not needed for manual deployment
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All core application features remain intact
5. **Better Focus**: Documentation now clearly targets manual deployment rather than multiple deployment methods

## Files Removed

- deploy.sh
- deploy-production.sh
- deploy-server.sh
- bootstrap.sh
- quick-start.sh
- scripts/ directory
- DEPLOYMENT.md
- PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md
- ZERO_TO_PRODUCTION.md
- ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md
- TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md

## Files Modified
